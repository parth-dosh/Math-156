This homework problem focuses on implementing a simple neural network from scratch to classify points in the XOR problem. It starts by loading a small toy dataset (xordata.pkl), which contains 800 training points and a separate test set. Each data point has two features, and the labels are binary (0 or 1). The network is trained using backpropagation, and its performance is evaluated on the test set. The implementation does not rely on high-level deep learning libraries like PyTorch; instead, it builds the network using NumPy to understand the fundamentals of neural networks.

After setting up the dataset, the notebook walks through defining the network architecture, initializing weights, and implementing forward and backward propagation. It explores different hyperparameters such as learning rates and hidden layer sizes to improve performance. The final model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy and visualizations of decision boundaries to see how well the network separates the classes. The results show how a simple neural network can learn the XOR function, which is not linearly separable, demonstrating the power of non-linear activation functions like ReLU or sigmoid.
